In this activity, we will build a scraping function that uses TMDB (an open movie database project compared to IMDb).
The web is a great resource of information, especially with the ever increasing amount of data available on the web.
Copying and pasting this information is time consuming and susceptible to many errors.
Web scraping is a way to extract this information automatically and transform it into a structured data set.
In this activity we will use screen scraping in which we extract data from the source code of a website with an HTML parser (this could also be done with regular expression matching).

Web scraping is not unique to R.
Python, Perl, and Java are also efficient tools for this.
However, this is a course in using R...

## Go go, SelectorGadget!

As we will see, most data on the web is available as HTML (hypertext markup language).
And, although it is structured (hierarchical/tree based), HTML data is often not available in an analysis-ready format (i.e., tidy).


`{rvest}` is a package by the tidyverse team that makes basic processing and manipulation of HTML data more straight forward.
However, it is not loaded with the tidyverse so you will need to load it separately.
In the space below, load `{tidyverse}` and `{rvest}`.



The core functions that you may find useful are:

- `read_html`: reads HTML data from a URL or character string
- `html_nodes`: selects specified nodes from the HTML document using CSS selectors
- `html_table`: parses an HTML table into a data frame
- `html_text`: extracts tag pairs' content
- `html_name`: extracts tags' names.
- `html_attrs`: extracts all of each tag's attributes
- `html_attr`: extracts tags' attribute value by name

Also, Hadley offers a [vignette](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/selectorgadget.html) for a handy tool browser add-in (SelectorGadget) that helps determine the minimal CSS selector you need to extract certain web page elements.
However, you might be comfortable inspecting (e.g., Ctrl + Shift + I) the HTML structure of a webpage.
Below are instructions to get started using SelectorGadget, but you are welcome to use the Inspect tool:

1. Install SelectorGadget in your web browser,
2. Go to TMDB's [Squid Game](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/93405) page,
3. Open SelectorGadget (a box will open in the bottom-right corner of your browser),
4. Explore different page elements (e.g., a movie's title).
  When you click on different items using SelectorGadget, they should highlight in green, generates a minimal CSS selector (e.g., `.10 a`), and highlight everything that is matched by that selector in yellow (and tell you how many items on the page match that selection).
5. Click on "Clear" to de-select it.
6. You can also search for different elements.
  Type `.panel` when you have nothing else selected (i.e., where it says "No valid path found.").
7. Click or type to explore at least these elements:
  - Title
  - Year
  - Content Rating

What are the minimal CSS selectors for the following elements: a show's title, year, and content rating?




First, we should make sure that we are allowed to.

In your **Console**, install `{robotstxt}`.

```{r check_tmdb}
library(robotstxt)
paths_allowed("http://www.tmdb.com")
```

Compare this to, for example:

```{r check_facebook}
paths_allowed("http://www.facebook.com")
```

Are you able to scrape data from TMDB or facebook?




Below is the start of a `scrape_tmdb` function.
The goal of this function is that when provided with a TV show's TMDB's URL, it will scrape the show's title, year, content rating, and user score.
User score will be the harder part of this so I have provided it for you.
Also, I show you how to make the output of this function organized in a tibble.
Use this TMBD page to help you determine the different attributes: `https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/93405`

```{r scrape_tmdb}
scrape_tmdb <- function(url){
  
  page <- read_html(url)
  
  # Update this part of the function to scrape the appropriate information
  
  # Scrape TMDB score
  score <- page %>% 
    html_node("span.icon") %>% 
    html_attr("class") %>% 
    str_replace(".+r(.+)", "\\1") %>% # `\\1` refers to string matched by the first capture group `(.+)`
    as.numeric()
  
  # Create a tibble containing all the scraped information
  tibble(
    title = title,
    year = year,
    rating = rating,
    score = score
  )
  
}
```


Use your function to obtain the information from this TV Show: `https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/2382`




## Gathering the data

Currently we have a function that can produce TV show information if provided with a URL, but where can we get a list of URLs of the most popular TV shows on TMDB?
Using inspect and/or SelectorGadget, explore how you might get the URLs from here: https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/top-rated

Write the code that reads in a list/vector of most popular TV shows on TMDB, then looks in the appropriate field to find the `"href"` (hint: `html_attr`) to obtain this list of URLs.
Call this character vector `tmdb_tv_urls` and it should have the top 20 tv shows.




After you have the vector of show subpage locations, you will need to *update* this vector to have each entry begin with  `"http://www.themoviedb.com"` so that you have valid URLs (hint: look into `paste`, `paste0`, or my favorite `glue::glue`)

Test `scrape_show_info` on the first few URLs (e.g., `tmdb_tv_urls[1]` is the *first* URL).



Now we will scrap the show information for every page for the top 100 TV shows.
We could do this by typing `scrap_show_info(tmdb_tv_urls[i])` for each of the 100 shows, but this would be extremely inefficient and we would probably accidentally scrape some TV shows multiple times while skipping others.

To do this, you will explore two methods:

1. Using a `for` loop
2. Using `purrr::map` functions

## `for` loop

Remember that with `for` loops, we first need to create an object that will hold the output from the loop.
First create an *empty* `tibble` called `tmdb_for_loop` with four columns: title, year, content rating, and user score.

- `title` which is a character column,
- `year` which is a numeric column,
- `rating` which is a numeric column, and
- `score` which is a numeric column.

Then, loop through the entries in your vector of `tmdb_tv_urls`.
In your loop, overwrite `tmdb_for_loop` with by *bind*ing the *rows* of the previous tibble with the next TV show's information tibble.

IF you get `HTTP Error 429 (Too many requests)`, you will want to slow down your website hit rate.
To do this, add `Sys.sleep(runif(1))` to the beginning of the `scrape_show_info` function (do it above and re-run the code).
This will add a random length pause (some equally likely random length between 0 and 1 seconds) to your function.
We only need to do this because we are scraping from a website - this is not necessary for all functions.




Verify that you have a complete tibble by visualizing the `score` for TV shows that made it on this top 20 list.




## `purrr::map`

`{purrr}` has a wealth of functions that make iterating functions more streamlined.

- [purrr site](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/)

What we want to do is *map* the `scrape_show_info` function to each element of our character vector `tmdb_tv_urls` to output a dataframe.
This is a purrr-fect (sorry) opportunity to use `map_df`...

![Sorry, not sorry](https://media.giphy.com/media/xUA7aVAw3xQ4pzYkiA/giphy.gif)

With the `map*` functions, you specify a list or vector that you want to apply a function to and it returns an object of the same length and the input.
There are several types of pre-identified outputs, but we want to return a dataframe/tibble so we will use `map_df`
Create a new object called `tmdb_map` that contains the show information for the top 100 TV shows using `map_df`




Verify that your `tmdb_for_loop` and `tmdb_map` objects contain the exact same information using the `waldo::compare` function.





## Update your function

Update your `scrape_show_info` function (do it above) to contain as much additional information that you can.
Also, can you scrape more than the first 20 shows?
Create a `tmdb_popular_shows` tibble that contains all this show information for the top 100 TV shows.
Save this tibble as a `.csv` file in a `/data` folder within your RStudio Project.
